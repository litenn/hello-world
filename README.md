# hello-world


Hello everyone, I am an auto Paint and Body Tech by trade but have played with computers off and on for quite a few years now and
have been interested in learning more for years but just couldn't seem to find or make the time to get it done. Hopefully i will now
I also Paint landscapes with oil paint on stretched canvas.
